|   ✅    |    20     | Valid Parentheses                            | Push opening brackets onto a stack. When encountering a closing bracket, check if the top of the stack is the matching opening bracket. If mismatch or stack is empty at wrong time => invalid.                      |
|  [ ]   |    155    | Min Stack                                   | Use an additional stack (or store pairs) to keep track of the current minimum each time you push. When popping, pop from both stacks if they are in sync.                                                            |
|  [ ]   |    232    | Implement Queue using Stacks                 | Maintain two stacks (input and output). For `pop/peek`, if the output stack is empty, transfer all elements from input stack to output stack.                                                                        |
|  [ ]   |    496    | Next Greater Element I                       | Use a stack to store elements’ indices. Traverse from right to left or left to right, and keep popping smaller elements to find the next greater for each element.                                                   |
|  [ ]   |    503    | Next Greater Element II                      | Circular variant of Next Greater Element. Similar stack approach; when the array ends, you can loop back or simulate with modulo, but each element is processed at most twice.                                       |
|  [ ]   |    739    | Daily Temperatures                           | Similar to Next Greater concept. Use a stack of indices. For each day, pop while current temperature is higher than the top index's temperature, record the distance.                                                |
|  [ ]   |    844    | Backspace String Compare                     | Simulate typing and backspaces with a stack for both strings, then compare final stacks (or final built strings).                                                                                                    |
|  [ ]   |    901    | Online Stock Span                            | Maintain a stack of `(price, span)`. Pop from the stack while the current price is higher or equal, accumulating spans. The top of the stack then indicates how far back the price was lower.                        |
|  [ ]   |   1021    | Remove Outermost Parentheses                 | Use a stack or a counter to identify “outer” parentheses. Whenever the stack transitions from empty to non-empty, you’re encountering an outer layer. Omit the first and last bracket of each primitive segment.     |
|  [ ]   |   1047    | Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String     | Use a stack to build the resulting string. If the current character is the same as the stack top, pop the stack (removing adjacent duplicates). Otherwise, push it.                                                  |
|  [ ]   |    150    | Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation             | Use a stack, push numbers. On an operator, pop top two numbers, apply the operator, then push the result back. Watch out for integer division/truncation and order of operands.                                      |
|  [ ]   |    71     | Simplify Path                                | Split the path by “/”, use a stack to store directory names. “..” means pop one directory if possible, “.” means do nothing, empty strings are skipped. Join the stack at the end.                                   |
|  [ ]   |    227    | Basic Calculator II                          | Use a stack to handle numbers and operators. Parse the string, handle `+`/`-` by pushing +/- number to stack, handle `*`/`/` by popping from the stack, applying, and pushing the result.                            |
|  [ ]   |    394    | Decode String                                | Use a stack to decode repeated segments. Push chars/numbers, when encountering `]`, pop until `[` to get the substring, then pop the repeat count, and push the expanded string back.                                |
|  [ ]   |    946    | Validate Stack Sequences                     | Simulate the push/pop sequence with a stack. Push the numbers in order, and whenever the top matches the next “popped” element, pop from the stack. If in the end everything matches, it’s valid.                    |
|  [ ]   |    402    | Remove K Digits                              | Use a stack-based approach to keep digits as small as possible. While the current digit is smaller than the stack’s top and you still can remove more digits (k > 0), pop from the stack.                            |
|   ✅    |    150    |                       |              |
