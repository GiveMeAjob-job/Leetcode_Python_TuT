| [ ]  | 130          | Surrounded Regions                     | Use BFS/DFS from the **border** 'O' cells to mark “safe” regions, then flip remaining 'O' to 'X'. Unvisited 'O' cells inside are surrounded.                                                                                |
| [ ]  | 133          | Clone Graph                           | Use BFS or DFS. For each node, create a copy, and recursively/iteratively clone its neighbors. Store visited (original -> clone) in a map to avoid re-cloning.                                                               |
| [ ]  | 200          | Number of Islands                     | Count connected components in a 2D grid. For each land cell ('1'), use BFS/DFS to mark all connected land cells as visited, then increment island count.                                                                     |
| [ ]  | 207          | Course Schedule                       | **Topological Sort** or DFS cycle detection in a directed graph (prerequisites). If there’s a cycle, you cannot finish all courses; otherwise, you can.                                                                     |
| [ ]  | 210          | Course Schedule II                    | Similar to #207, but you also need an actual topological order of courses. Use BFS (Kahn’s algorithm) or DFS to produce a valid order if no cycle exists.                                                                    |
| [ ]  | 261          | Graph Valid Tree                      | Check if the undirected graph is connected (exactly one connected component) and has exactly `n-1` edges. You can do DFS/BFS to check connectivity and compare edge count, or use Union-Find.                                |
| [ ]  | 323          | Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph | Similar to #200 but in a general graph structure. Count how many connected components exist using DFS/BFS or Union-Find.                                                                                 |
| [ ]  | 332          | Reconstruct Itinerary                 | Build a directed graph of flights, then use Hierholzer’s algorithm (Eulerian path) or a DFS approach that always picks the lexicographically smallest edge next.                                                             |
| [ ]  | 399          | Evaluate Division                     | Build a graph where each node is a variable, edges store the division ratio. Use DFS/BFS to find path from `A` to `B` and multiply the ratios to get the answer.                                                             |
| [ ]  | 417          | Pacific Atlantic Water Flow           | From the perspective of the two oceans, do a BFS/DFS from Pacific edges and Atlantic edges. Mark cells reachable by each ocean. The intersection of these reachable sets is the answer.                                      |
| [ ]  | 684          | Redundant Connection                  | In a tree with n nodes, an extra edge creates a cycle. Use Union-Find to detect the first edge that causes a union of two already-connected components.                                                                      |
| [ ]  | 785          | Is Graph Bipartite?                   | Use DFS/BFS and color nodes in two colors. If you ever find a conflict (trying to color a node in a color but it’s already colored in the opposite color), the graph is not bipartite.                                        |
| [ ]  | 797          | All Paths From Source to Target       | Use DFS (or backtracking) from source (node 0) to target (node n-1), collecting paths. Return all possible paths in a directed acyclic graph.                                                                                 |
| [ ]  | 802          | Find Eventual Safe States             | States that eventually lead to a cycle are unsafe. Use DFS with state marking (unvisited, visiting, visited). If from a node you can only go to safe nodes, then it’s safe, otherwise not.                                    |
| [ ]  | 990          | Satisfiability of Equality Equations  | Use Union-Find for “==” equations to unify sets. Then check “!=” equations: if the two variables are in the same set, contradiction. Otherwise, it’s satisfiable.                                                            |
