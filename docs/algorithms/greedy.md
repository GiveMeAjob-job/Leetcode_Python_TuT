| [ ] | 455          | Assign Cookies                               | Sort both kids and cookies. Greedily assign the smallest cookie that satisfies each kid in ascending order.                                                                                                                                              |
| [ ] | 376          | Wiggle Subsequence                           | Greedy approach: track the direction of the last “wiggle” and update the length when the direction changes (up or down).                                                                                                                                 |
| [ ] | 122          | Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II           | Greedy to sum up every profit for each ascending segment. Essentially, buy low and sell high whenever there’s a price increase.                                                                                                                          |
| [ ] | 55           | Jump Game                                    | Maintain the farthest reachable index as you iterate. If at any point your current index is beyond the farthest reachable, you can’t proceed.                                                                                                            |
| [ ] | 45           | Jump Game II                                 | Track the current “window” of jumps and the next maximum reach. When you pass the current coverage, you must have made another jump.                                                                                                                     |
| [ ] | 134          | Gas Station                                  | If total gas < total cost => no solution. Otherwise, start from 0, accumulate `tank += gas[i] - cost[i]`. If `tank` drops below 0, restart from the next station, reset `tank = 0`.                                                                      |
| [ ] | 763          | Partition Labels                             | Greedy by tracking the last occurrence of each character. As you iterate, extend a partition until you pass the farthest last occurrence of any character in the current segment.                                                                        |
| [ ] | 406          | Queue Reconstruction by Height               | Sort people by descending height (and if tie, ascending k-value). Insert them into a list at the position k. This ensures they end up in correct order.                                                                                                  |
| [ ] | 452          | Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons   | Sort intervals by their end coordinate. Greedily shoot an arrow at the end of the first interval; skip all overlapping intervals, then shoot another arrow at the end of the next non-overlapping interval.                                              |
| [ ] | 435          | Non-overlapping Intervals                    | Sort intervals by end time. Greedily pick intervals with the earliest finishing time, and skip those that overlap with the already picked interval.                                                                                                      |
| [ ] | 56           | Merge Intervals                              | Sort intervals by start time. Merge overlapping ones by checking if `current_start <= last_merged_end`; if so, update the merged end; otherwise, push a new interval.                                                                                    |
| [ ] | 1029         | Two City Scheduling                          | Sort by difference of the cost (cost A - cost B). Then greedily send the person with bigger positive difference to B and bigger negative difference to A, or use a more direct approach of sorting by the absolute difference.                           |
| [ ] | 881          | Boats to Save People                         | Sort the people by weight. Use two pointers from ends: if the heaviest can fit with the lightest, pair them in one boat; otherwise, the heaviest goes alone.                                                                                             |
