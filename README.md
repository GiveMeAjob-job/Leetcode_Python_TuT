# Leetcode_Python_TuT

Welcome to **Leetcode_Python_TuT** — a repository where we organize and explain common **LeetCode** problems using **Python**. The code and explanatory notes are grouped by algorithmic or data-structure topics. We hope this approach helps you better understand LeetCode challenges and related concepts.

Below, you’ll find links to subtopics. Each topic has its own `.md` file in the `docs/` folder, containing explanations and code samples:

- [Backtracking](docs/backtracking.md)  
- [Dynamic Programming (DP)](docs/dp.md)  
- [Graph](docs/graph.md)  
- [Greedy](docs/greedy.md)  
- [Heap](docs/heap.md)  
- [Linked List](docs/linkedlist.md)  
- [Sliding Window](docs/slidingwindows.md)  
- [Trees](docs/trees.md)  
- [Two Pointers](docs/twopointers.md)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GiveMeAjob-job/Leetcode_Python_TuT.git
   cd Leetcode_Python_TuT
   ```

2. (Optional) **Set up a virtual environment** and **install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate         # Linux/Mac
   # or
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run code examples**:  
   - Navigate into a specific folder (e.g., `heap/`) and execute `python example_filename.py`.
   - Consult each `.md` file in `docs/` for more details about how the solutions and demos are structured.
